YouTube Annotations was a feature launched by YouTube in 2008 that allowed video creators to add text, links, and interactive elements to their videos in order to enhance the viewing experience. YouTube removed this feature in 2019.

ASS (Advanced SubStation Alpha) is a common external subtitle format. Compared to other subtitle formats, it can set fonts, colors, positions, and even add images and effects to enhance your viewing experience.

This tool can help you convert YouTube annotations into ASS subtitle files, which you can then play or add to your videos. If you do not need this feature, it is recommended to use [AnnotationsRestored](https://github.com/isaackd/AnnotationsRestored).
