"selected? This time to super for the military Secretary, so that the "
"previous work.\" Chao was made again, solid desire to benefit its troops, "
"Chao said: \"I would like to be from the thirty-odd people is enough. If "
"there is any danger, more benefits for tired.\"\n"
"\n"
"At that time in the filler King Guangde new breakthrough Shache, so Xiong "
"Zhang South Road, [10] and the Xiongnu sent an envoy to guard his country. "
"Chao both west, first to Yu Fen. Guangde rituals and ideas are very thin. "
"And its customs believe in witch. The witch said: \"Why does God's wrath "
"want to go to Han? The Han envoys had piebald horses,[11] and they were "
"eager to get them to honor me.\" Guangde sent an envoy to Chao to ask for a "
"horse. Chao knew the situation well, and authorized him to ask for the "
"horse, but he asked Wu to come and fetch it. When the witch arrived, Chao "
"chopped off his head and sent it to Guangde. Guangde heard that Chao had "
"killed the envoys of the Xiong Nu in Shanshan, so he was very frightened, so "
"he attacked and killed the Xiong Nu envoys and surrendered to Chao. Chao "
"gave the king of Xiong Nu the following gifts, and then he pacified him.\n"
"\n"
"At that time, the king of Guzi Jian was established by the Xiong Nu, relying "
"on the power of the captives, according to the northern road, attacked "
"Shule, killed the king,[12] and established the Guzi people Tou entitled "
"Shule king. Next spring, Chao from the idle road to Shule. To go to the "
"Toutai live ninety miles from the city of Nuanjou, the reverse sent the "
"mandarin Tian anxiety first to surrender. He said, \"Toutou is not a Shule "
"species, and the people of Shule will not use his life. If he did not "
"surrender immediately, he could be executed.\" Anxious to arrive, Toutou see "
"Anxious light and weak, but no intention to surrender. He was not prepared "
"for this, so he went ahead and kidnapped Toutou and bound him. He was taken "
"by surprise and ran away in fear. Anxious to report to Chao, Chao "
"immediately went there, all summoned the Shule generals and officials, said "
"that Guzi is a lawlessness, so he set up his late brother, Zizhong, as the "
"king,[13] and the country was in great fear. Zhong and his officials asked "
"to kill Toutou, but Chao refused to listen to him, wanting to show his "
"authority, he released and sent him away. Shule thus became enmity with "
"Guzi.\n"
"\n"
"Eighteen years, the emperor died. Yanqi, who was in great mourning in China,"
"[14] attacked Chen Mu, the governor. Chao was isolated and helpless, while "
"Guzi and Gumo sent troops to attack Shule. [15] Chao guard Panjou City, and "
"Zhong for the head and tail, soldiers and officials single less, refused to "
"defend for more than a year. Suzong first ascended to the throne, to Chen "
"Mutsu new no, afraid of super single danger can not stand on their own, "
"issued an edict to levy super. Chao sent back, Shule country worried. His "
"lieutenant, Li Yu, said: \"If the Han ambassador abandons me, I will be "
"annihilated by Guzi again. I can't bear to see Han's envoy go.\" He cut "
"himself with his sword. When Chao returned to Yutian, the princes and lords "
"below all cried and said, \"I am like a parent to the Han envoy, so I really "
"can't go.\" They hugged each other's horses and feet, and were not allowed "
"to go. Fearing that Yutian would not listen to him in the east and wanting "
"to fulfill his ambition, Chao returned to Shule. The two cities of Shule "
"surrendered to Guzi since Chao's departure, and they were joined by the army "
"of Yutou. [16] Chao captured and decapitated the rebels, broke Yutou and "
"killed more than 600 people, and Shule was restored to peace.\n"
"\n"
"Jianchu three years, Chao rate Shule, Kangju, Yu Filli, detained Mi soldiers "
"10,000 people attacked Gumo stone city, [17] broken, beheading seven hundred "
"levels. Chao wants to thus ill leveled the countries, [18] is on the sparse "
"request for troops. Said: \"I steal see the first emperor wants to open the "
"western region, so the north hit the Xiongnu, west to make foreign "
"countries, Shanshan, Yu Fillian instantly to the chemical. Today's Sukumi, "
"Shache, Shule, Yuezhi, Usun, Kangju is willing to return to the annexation, "
"and want to work together to destroy the Guzi, Pingtong Han Road. If we win "
"the Tortoise, we will be one hundred percent of those who have not yet been "
"served in the Western Region. Chen Fu from the thought, pawns, small "
"officials, really want to serve from the Valley Ji extinct area, a few Zhang "
"Qian abandoned the wilderness. [19] The former Wei Jiang, a great man of the "
"country, can still and series of the Rong, [20] not to mention that the "
"minister by the authority of the Han Dynasty, but not a cut of the knife a "
"cut of the use of it? [21] The previous generation of discussants are said "
"to take thirty-six countries, the number for the broken Xiongnu right arm. "
"[22] now the Western countries, since the day of entry, not to the chemical, "
"[23] the size of the happy, tribute unceasingly, only Yanqi, Guzi only did "
"not obey. I was with the official thirty-six people to make the absolute "
"region, was suffering hardship. Since the lone guard Shule, now five years, "
"Hu Yi feelings, I quite know. When asked about the size of their cities and "
"towns, they all said, 'Leaning on the Han and relying on the sky and so on'. "
"In order to be effective, then the onion collar can be passed, [24] onion "
"collar through the turtle can be cut. Today, it is appropriate to worship "
"the Guzi son Baiba as its king, with hundreds of foot and horsemen to send "
"it, and all the countries even troops, years and months, the Guzi can be "
"birds. To attack the barbarians with the barbarians, the plan of the good "
"also. [25] I see the Shache, Shule fields are fertile and wide, grass and "
"animal husbandry, not more than Dunhuang, Shanshan also, [26] soldiers can "
"not cost China and food self-sufficiency. And Gumo, Wenshu two kings, "
"especially for the turtle set, [27] both its species, more mutual "
"bitterness, its art must have surrendered. If the two countries to "
"surrender, then the tortoise since broken. I hope that the next minister "
"chapter, reference to act. I would be happy to die, but I have no regrets. I "
"super area, especially the gods, steal the unready stiff servant, see the "
"western region pacified, His Majesty lifted the goblet of ten thousand "
"years, [28] recommended Xun ancestral temple, cloth great joy in the world."
"\" [29] the book, the emperor knows that his work can be accomplished, the "
"discussion wants to give soldiers. Pingling people Xu Gan Su and super "
"comrades, on the sparse willing to fight for the super. Five years, so dry "
"for the fake Sima, will be 㢮 criminal and righteous from a thousand people "
"on the super.\n"
"\n"
"First, Shache thought that the Han soldiers did not come out, and then "
"surrendered to Guzi, and Shule captain Fanchen also revolted. [30] Xu Gan "
"would arrive, Chao and Gan attacked Fanchen, defeated, decapitated more than "
"a thousand heads, and captured many mouths. After breaking Fan Chen, Chao "
"wanted to attack Guzi. Wusun soldiers, it is appropriate because of its "
"strength, was on the said: \"Wusun big country, control string 100,000, so "
"Emperor Wu's wife to the Princess, [31] to the Xiao Xuan Emperor, and then "
"get its use. [32] now can send envoys to consolation, with a total force.\" "
"The emperor. Eight years, worship super for the general soldier long "
"history, fake drums and blowers banner. [33] to Xu Gan as the military "
"Secretary of the horse, do not send Wei Hou Li Yi escort Wu Sun messenger, "
"give the size of the Kunya following the brocade and silk. [34]\n"
"\n"
"Li Yi began to arrive in the filler, and when the turtle attacked Shule, "
"fear dare not go forward, because of the letter Chen Western Region of the "
"work can not be accomplished, but also the full destruction of the super "
"embracing the love of his wife, holding love of his son, peace and happiness "
"in a foreign country, no internal Gu Xin. Chao heard, sighed: \"the body is "
"not Zeng Sen and have three to the slander, I am afraid to see the doubt at "
"that time carry on.\" [35] then went to his wife. The emperor knew that the "
"super loyal, is cut to blame the eup said: \"even if the super embraced the "
"love of his wife, holding love of his son, wanting to return to the "
"thousands of people, how can all be with the super with heart?\" He ordered "
"Eup to go to Chao to accept the festival. He ordered Chao to go to the city "
"to accept the governorship, and then ordered Chao to say, \"If Eup is "
"appointed to a foreign post, he will stay there and work with him.\" Chiu "
"immediately sent Eup to return Wu Sun's son to the capital. Xu Gan said to "
"Chao, \"I have ruined the king and wanted to defeat the Western Region, why "
"don't you keep him by the imperial decree and send other officials to send "
"him back to the capital?\" Chao said: \"This is not a good thing to say! I "
"have ruined the super, so I am now sending it. I have no guilt in my "
"introspection, so I don't care what people say! [36] It is not a loyal "
"minister to keep him quickly.\"\n"
"\n"
"Next year, sent false Secretary and four people such as Gong will be 800 "
"soldiers to Chao, Chao because of the Shule, Yu Fillian soldiers to hit the "
"Shache. Shache Yin pass make Shule Wang Zhong, mouth to heavy benefits [37] "
"Zhong then counter from it, west to protect the city of Wu that is. Chao Nai "
"more established its government minister Cheng Da as Shule King, all of its "
"not against the people to attack Zhong. Accumulated half a year, and Kangju "
"sent elite troops to save it, Chao can not go down. At that time, the Yuezhi "
"new and Kangju marriage, close to each other, Chao Nai made a gift of silk "
"and silk to the king of the Yuezhi, so that the king of Kangju, King Kangju "
"was dismissed from the army, the execution of the Zhong to return to his "
"country, U that the city was then surrendered to the super.\n"
"\n"
"Three years later, Zhong said that the king of Kangju borrowed troops, but "
"also based on the loss of the center,[38] secretly with the Guzi conspiracy, "
"sent an envoy to fraudulently surrendered to Chao. Chao was aware of his "
"treachery inside, but he was falsely allowed to do so outside. Zhong was "
"delighted, that is, from the light riding to Chao. Chao Mi Le soldiers to "
"wait for, for the supply of Zhang set up music. [39] Wine line, is scolded "
"officials tied Zhong beheaded. Because of the breakthrough of its crowd, "
"killed more than seven hundred people, the South Road then attempted to "
"pass.\n"
"\n"
"Next year, the super sent in the fill in the countries of 25,000 soldiers, "
"the Shache. The king of Guzi sent the left general to send Wenjiu, Gumo, "
"Yutou and 50,000 people to save it. Chao called the generals and schools and "
"the king of Yu Fillian said: \"This is a small number of soldiers will not "
"be able to defeat, the plan is to disperse. Yu Fillian from this and east, "
"long history also in this west return, can be required to night drums and "
"send.\" Yin slow gain raw mouth. The king of Guzi heard the great joy, since "
"the 10,000 riders in the western border cover super, the king of Wenjiu will "
"be 8,000 riders in the eastern border by mere Yu Fillian. Super know that "
"the two captives have been out, secretly called the Department of Le troops, "
"chicken chirping to go to the Shachette camp, Hu Da alarmed run away, chased "
"and chopped more than 5,000 levels, and captured its horses and animals and "
"property. Shacha then surrendered, Guzi and so on because of the retreat, "
"since then the mighty Western Region.\n"
"\n"
"At the beginning of the month, the month of the Han hit the Cheshi have been "
"successful, is the year of tribute to the treasures, Fu Bak, Shi Zi, [40] "
"because of the Han Princess. Chao refused to return his envoys, and was thus "
"resentful. In the second year of the Yongyuan era, the Yuezhi sent their "
"deputy king Xie to attack Chao with 70,000 soldiers. The army of Chao was "
"small, and they were all very frightened. Chao said to the soldiers: "
"\"Although the Yuezhi soldiers, but thousands of miles over the onion collar "
"to come, non-transportation, why worry about evil? But when the collection "
"of valley firm defense, his hunger poor self-surrender, but dozens of days "
"to carry on.\" Xie attempted to attack the super, not, and money plunder no "
"gain. Super degree of its food will be exhausted, will seek help from the "
"Guzi, was sent hundreds of soldiers in the eastern border to be. Xie fruit "
"sent riders a gift of gold, silver, pearls and jade to bribe Guzi. Chao "
"ambushed troops to cover the attack, killed all of them, and held the head "
"of his envoy to show Xie. Xie was shocked and sent an envoy to ask for "
"forgiveness, wishing to return alive. Chao was not allowed to send him back. "
"Yuezhi was then greatly shocked, and made contributions every year.\n"
"\n"
"Next year, Guzi, Gumo and Wenshu all surrendered, and Chao was appointed as "
"the capital protector and Xu Gan as the chief historian. Bai Ba was "
"appointed as the king of Guzi, and Yao Guang, the minister of justice, was "
"sent to send him to Guzi. Chao and Guang coerced Guzi to abolish its king "
"Yuliduo and establish Baiba, and asked Guang to return Yuliduo to the "
"capital. Chao resided in Guzi and its Qiancheng, while Xu Gan was in Shule. "
"In the western region, only Yanqi, Guanshu, and Yulai had no guardian "
"before, and they had second thoughts, but the rest of the region was fully "
"settled.\n"
"\n"
"In the fall of the sixth year, Chao attempted to send Guzi, Shanshan and "
"other eight countries to discuss Yanqi with a total of 70,000 soldiers and "
"1,400 officials and visitors. Soldiers to the Yulai border, and sent to tell "
"Yanqi, Yulai, Guisu, said: \"The capital guards come, want to pacify the "
"three countries. That is, want to change to the good, should send adults to "
"welcome, [41] when the reward for the king and marquis has been, after the "
"matter that is returned. Now give the king color five hundred pi.\" The king "
"of Yanqi, Guang, sent his left general, Bei Quizhi, to welcome Chao with "
"oxen and wine. [42] Chao interrogated the quiver branch and said, \"Although "
"you are the son of Xiongnu, you are now holding the power of the country. "
"Dugu came, the king did not welcome in time, all your sins.\" Or said Chao "
"can be killed. Chao said: \"not your reach. This person's power is important "
"to the king, this is not in their country and kill them, so that the self-"
"suspicion, equipment to guard the danger, how to get to the city under it!\" "
"So give and dispatch. Guang Nai and adults to welcome Chao in Yulai, "
"dedication of treasures.\n"
"\n"
"The Yanqi country has the danger of the reed bridge, Guang is the bridge, do "
"not want to let the Han army into the country. The Han army was not allowed "
"to enter the country. [43] In July, he arrived at Yanqi, twenty miles from "
"the city, and camped in the middle of a large marsh. Guang was surprised and "
"frightened, and he wanted to drive all his men into the mountain to protect "
"them. Yuan Meng, the left marquis of Yanqi, had been a hostage to the "
"capital, and secretly sent an envoy to tell Chao, who immediately beheaded "
"him to show his disbelief. The king of Yanqi, Wang Fang of Yulai, and 30 "
"people from the northern quiver of the country went to Chao at the same "
"time. The state phase of the belly of the seventeen people such as long fear "
"of execution, [44] all died into the sea, and the king of Guan Su did not "
"come. When he was seated, Chao angrily interrogated Guang, saying: \"Why "
"didn't King Guanshu come? The belly of a long time and so on the reason for "
"fleeing?\" Then scolded the mandarins to collect wide, Pan equal to Chen Mu "
"old city, beheaded, passed the head of the capital. Because of indulgence in "
"troops money plunder, beheading more than 5,000 levels, get the mouth of "
"15,000 people, horses and livestock cattle and sheep more than 300,000 head, "
"more established Yuan Meng as Yanqi King. Chao stayed in Yanqi for half a "
"year to comfort him. So all the fifty countries in the western region all "
"Naji internal belonging to it.\n"
"\n"
"Next year, he issued an edict saying: \"In the past, the Xiongnu had "
"monopolized the Western Regions and invaded Hexi, and at the end of "
"Yongping, the city gates were closed day and night. The late emperor deeply愍"
"边萌婴罗寇害，乃命将帅击右地，破白山，临蒲类，[45]取车师，城郭诸国震慑响应，"
"so opened the western region, set the capital guard. And Yanqi Wang Shun, "
"Shun Zizhong sole plan rebellious, relying on its narrowness, overthrowing "
"the capital guard, and the officials. The late emperor valued the order of "
"Yuan Yuan and was afraid of the rise of military service, so he asked the "
"military secretary Ban Chao to settle in the west of Fillian. Chao then over "
"the onion collar, as far as the county, [46] in and out of the twenty-two "
"years, no confidence from. Re-establishment of its king, and appeasement of "
"its people. Do not move China, do not bother the Ronshi, get far and "
"barbarians, with the heart of the foreigners, and the heavenly punishment, "
"remit the shame of the past, in order to avenge the generals. [47] \"Sima "
"law\" said: 'reward is not more than a month, want people to quickly see for "
"the benefit of good also.' He sealed Chao as Marquis of Dingyuan, with a "
"thousand households.\" [48]\n"
"\n"
"Chao was in a remote area for a long time, and was old enough to think of "
"the land. Twelve years, said: \"I heard that Taigong sealed Qi, five burial "
"weeks, fox death head mound, generation of horses according to the wind. "
"[49] The Zhou and Qi in the same thousands of miles of leisure in the Middle "
"Kingdom, not to mention in the remote area, I can not rely on the wind of "
"the first hill of the thought of the small ministers? The barbarian custom, "
"fear of strong insult old. [50] I super dog and horse teeth annihilation, "
"often afraid of the decline, dying stiff servant, lonely souls abandoned "
"donation. In the past, Su Wu stayed in the Xiongnu still nineteen years, now "
"I am fortunate to have Fengjie with gold and silver to protect the Western "
"Region, [51] such as since the end of the life of the Tuen Department, there "
"is no hate, but I am afraid that the next generation or the name of the "
"ministers for the Western Region. I don't dare to hope to Jiuquan County, "
"but wish to be born into the Yumen Pass. [52] I am old and sick, so I risked "
"my life to speak in goze, and I would like to send my son, Yong, with the "
"offerings to enter the fortress. [53] When I am alive, I will let Yong see "
"the Middle Kingdom.\" And Chao's sister Cao Shou's wife, Zhao, also wrote to "
"ask Chao to say:\n"
"\n"
"    Concubine with the birth of brother in the western region of the escort "
"Dingyuan Hou Chao, fortunate to have a small merit special rewards, the "
"title listed in the Marquis of Tong, the position of two thousand stone. "
"Heaven's grace is absolutely, it is not a small courtier should be honored. "
"Chao's first out, the will to donate his body life, to set up a small merit, "
"in order to Chen effect. Will ChenMu change, the road isolation, super with "
"a turn side of the absolute territory, know the countries, because of its "
"soldiers, every attack, always for the first, body was gold razor, [54] do "
"not avoid death. Lai Meng Your Majesty's spirit, and get to extend the life "
"of the desert, so far accumulated thirty years. Flesh and bones are "
"separated, no longer know each other. All the people I have been with have "
"passed away. I am now seventy years old, the oldest. He is now seventy years "
"old. He has become old and sick, his hair is not black, his hands are not "
"kind,[55] his ears and eyes are not clear, and he can only walk with a "
"stick. Although I want to do my best to repay the grace of heaven, forced by "
"the end of the year, the dog and horse teeth. The nature of the barbarians, "
"rebellious and insulting to the old, and super day and night into the "
"ground, long time no generation, fear of opening the source of malefactors, "
"born of the heart of rebellion. And the Secretary of State and the generals "
"of the government are all in mind, and are not willing to think far ahead. "
"If there is a stroke of violence, the super of the gas can not be from the "
"heart, it will be on the loss of the country's success for many generations, "
"the next abandoned the loyal ministers try their best to use, sincere pain "
"also. Therefore, the super thousands of miles to return to the sincerity, "
"self-presentation of the bitter emergency, extended neck over the hope, "
"three years in the present, not the province recorded. [56]\n"
"\n"
"    I heard that in ancient times, fifteen receive troops, sixty return, "
"[57] also have a rest not to serve. Because His Majesty to filial piety in "
"the world, get the heart of the nations, do not leave the small countries of "
"the minister, the situation of the super to prepare for the position of "
"Marquis, so I dare to touch the death of the super to beg for mourning, "
"checkpoints super the rest of the year. [58] a get back to life, see again "
"Que Ting, so that the country will never have to labor far away from the "
"worry, the Western Region without the worry of the warehouse, super get long "
"to be buried in the bones of the king of the grace of the Zifang mourning "
"the benefits of the old. [59] Poetry: \"the people are also labor stop, car "
"can be well-off, benefit this China, to appease the Quartet.\" [60] Chao has "
"a book with the concubine of life, I am afraid that we will not see each "
"other again. Concubine sincerity hurt super to the strong years of loyalty "
"and filial piety in the desert, fatigue old will be donated to the death in "
"the wilderness, really can be pitied. If I am not saved, there will be a "
"change in the future of Chao, and I am glad that Chao's family has been able "
"to get a loan from Zhao's mother, Wei Ji, who had first asked for it. [61] I "
"am a foolish and ignorant concubine who does not know the great "
"righteousness and has violated the taboo.\n"
"\n"
"The book, the emperor felt his words, was levied Chao return.\n"
"\n"
"Chao in the Western thirty-one years. Fourteen years in August to Luoyang, "
"worship as a shooting school lieutenant. Chao had been suffering from "
"Xiongwu disease, and when he arrived, the disease increased. The emperor "
"sent the Yellow Gate to ask about his illness and gave him medicine. He died "
"in September of that year at the age of seventy-one. The court counseled him "
"and gave him gifts as a token of appreciation. His son Xiong succeeded him.\n"
"\n"
"At the beginning, Chao was recruited, and he took the position of Captain "
"Ren Shang as the capital guard. He gave an account with Chao. Shang said, "
"\"Your lord has been in a foreign country for more than 30 years, and I have "
"been following in your footsteps for a long time, so I think it would be a "
"good idea if I could teach you something.\" Chao said: \"old age and loss of "
"wisdom, Renjun number when the big position, not Banchao can not do! Must "
"have no choice, I would like to enter my humble opinion. The foreign "
"officials are not filial sons and daughters of filial piety, all the sins "
"migrate to make up for the border of Tuen Mun. And barbarians with birds and "
"beasts of the heart, difficult to raise easy to lose. Now the king is strict "
"and anxious, the water is clear and no big fish, the government shall not be "
"under the peace. [62] should be swung anonymous simple, wide small faults, "
"the outline only.\" After the departure of Chao, Shang privately said to his "
"relatives, \"I thought that Banjun would have a strategy, but what he said "
"today is just plain.\" Sheung arrived a few years later, and the Western "
"Region rebelled against the Broker, and the Broker was levied for the crime, "
"as cautioned by the Broker.\n"
"\n"
"He has three sons. The eldest son, Mr. Xiong, was promoted to the rank of "
"Captain of Tun Cavalry. Will be rebellious Qiang Kou Sanfu, Xiong will be "
"five battalions of soldiers Tun Changan, on the worship of the Beijing "
"Zhaoyin. Xiong died, the son began to inherit, Shang Qinghe Xiao Wang female "
"Princess Yincheng. Lord Shun emperor's aunt, your pride and promiscuity, and "
"the favorite living in the curtain, and called the first into the ambush "
"under the bed. Beginning to accumulate anger, Yongjian five years, so pulled "
"out the blade to kill the Lord. The emperor was furious and beheaded Bei, "
"and all of his children abandoned the city. The youngest son of Chao was "
"Yong. "
